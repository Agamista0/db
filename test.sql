Lu Ning was now a beautiful swan who had turned into an ugly duckling. Everybody waited for the opportunity to laugh at her. They wanted to see how she would survive after being pampered like a princess for eighteen years. However, Lu Ning wasn’t afraid at all. So what if she was poor? All she had to do was earn money. But before she could bring wealth to her family, they brought her home and started counting stacks of cash. Her eldest brother, a business mogul, offered her a few companies. “These are all yours now. There are more if you want them. You can choose anything from dining, entertainment, fashion, theme parks, and any industry you can think of.” “Ning, would you like to participate in a talent show? I’ll write you a recommendation letter,” her second brother, a major celebrity, asked. Even her youngest brother, a computer expert, said, “Sis, whoever says bad things about you on the internet will never get to use it again.” “…” Lu Ning was speechless. Wasn’t her family poor and useless? “Ning, if you don’t like gold, I’ll get someone to bring you diamonds instead. You can have diamonds embedded in all your clothes. What do you think? Hang on. I’ll get someone to do it right away!” Lu Ning’s mother said.”Ning, are you getting bored of the black card? Why don’t I give you one with a credit limit?

Lu Ning didn’t even have any opportunity to contribute. There was nothing for her to do. However…”Come and be our boss!” A secret organization approached her.”Come and be my successor!” The director of a research center approached her.”Is this never going to end?
